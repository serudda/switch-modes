# Model Modes - Marketing Brief

## The Hook

**"I cut my AI costs by 70% with 4 simple commands. Here's how."**

**Alternative (Conversational angle):**
**"Just told my AI agent: 'install model-modes'. Now I'm saving 70% on API costs."**

---

## The Problem

- AI is expensive. GPT-4/Claude Opus costs add up fast
- Most tasks don't need premium models
- But switching models manually is tedious
- Users overpay because it's easier than optimizing

**The pain:** You're paying $0.60/1M tokens when $0.08/1M would work fine.

---

## The Solution

**Model Modes** - Dynamic model switching for OpenClaw

4 modes. Simple commands. Instant switching.

```
eco mode       → Cheapest (summaries, quick Q&A)
balanced mode  → Daily driver (general work)
smart mode     → Powerful (complex reasoning)
max mode       → Maximum (critical tasks)
```

**Real savings:** 60-80% cost reduction reported by users.

## Key Benefits

✅ **Instant ROI** - Save money from day 1  
✅ **Zero friction** - Natural language commands  
✅ **Flexible** - Works with any model provider  
✅ **Smart** - Right tool for each job  
✅ **Private** - All config stored locally

## Target Audience

### Primary
- **OpenClaw users** paying for premium API access
- **Heavy AI users** with high monthly costs ($100+/month)
- **Developers/creators** optimizing workflows

### Secondary
- **Companies** managing AI budgets for teams
- **Consultants** needing flexible model access
- **Experimenters** testing different models

---

## Positioning

**Category:** Cost optimization utility  
**Vibe:** Smart, practical, no-nonsense  
**Tone:** "I built this because I was tired of overpaying"

**Not:** Enterprise sales pitch, complex automation, vendor lock-in  
**Yes:** Simple tool, immediate value, community-first

## Content Angles

### Twitter/X Thread (Option 1: Conversational angle)
> "Just told my AI: 'install model-modes'
> 
> 2 minutes later I had 4 cost modes set up.
> 
> eco/balanced/smart/max
> 
> Last month's API bill: $300
> This month: $80
> 
> No terminal commands. All conversational.
> 
> Here's how 🧵"

### Twitter/X Thread (Option 2: Technical angle)
> "I spent $300 on Claude API last month.
> 
> Most of it was wasted on tasks that GPT-3.5 could handle.
> 
> So I built a simple switcher - 4 modes, instant switching.
> 
> Last month: $80.
> 
> Here's how it works 🧵"

### LinkedIn Post
> After analyzing my AI API usage, I realized 70% of my costs came from using premium models for simple tasks.
> 
> I created Model Modes - a free OpenClaw skill that lets you switch between cost tiers instantly.
> 
> The result? 70% cost reduction with zero sacrifice in quality.
